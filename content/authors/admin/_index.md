Hello! I'm Zhiwei Shao (邵志伟), currently a research assistant at [Department of Astronomy](http://astro.sjtu.edu.cn/en/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/). I graduated from [School of Astronomy and Space Science](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). I am eager to learn about both theoretical and observational aspects of cosmology and galaxy evolution, while currently I'm also working on the kilonova ejecta structure associated with AT 2017gfo. You can take a look at my {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" "newtab" %}}CV{{% /staticref %}} for more details.
