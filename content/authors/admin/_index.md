Hello! I'm Zhiwei Shao (邵志伟), currently a fourth year undergraduate student at [School of Astronomy and Space Science](https://astronomy.nju.edu.cn/), [Nanjing University](https://www.nju.edu.cn/en/main.psp). I am eager to learn about both theoretical and observational aspects of cosmology and galaxy evolution, while currently I'm also working on the kilonova ejecta structure associated with AT 2017gfo. You can find my CV {{% staticref "files/cv.pdf" "newtab" %}}here{{% /staticref %}} for more details.
